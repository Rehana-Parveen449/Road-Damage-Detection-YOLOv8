# 🚀 Road Defect Detection using YOLOv8 Segmentation

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end computer vision solution for detecting and segmenting different types of road defects using YOLOv8 Nano Segmentation models.

Instead of training a single model for all road conditions, three specialized segmentation models were developed independently for:

- Road Crack Detection
- Pothole Detection
- Road Sign & Road Marking Detection

The trained models were integrated into a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload road images, select a detection model, and visualize segmentation results in real time.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect road surface cracks using image segmentation.
- Identify potholes for road maintenance applications.
- Detect road signs and road markings.
- Build an interactive Streamlit application for inference.
- Demonstrate an end-to-end deep learning workflow from training to deployment.

## 📂 Dataset

The project was developed using three independently curated datasets for road defect detection.

The datasets include annotated images for:

- Road surface cracks
- Potholes
- Road signs
- Road markings

The datasets were customized and organized using Roboflow to maintain a consistent annotation format compatible with YOLOv8 segmentation training.
